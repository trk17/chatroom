This is an implementation of a chatroom. Server.c acts as the backend of the
chatroom and handles users entering and leaving the chatroom. Client.c is run
by the users to enter the chatroom. The chatroom uses a standard UDP connection.

To compile the programs simple run 'make'

Command Line Arguments:
./server {Port Number}

./client {Username} {Server IP Address} {Port Number}

Once programs are running the following are special commands:

/ping -   Pings the server and responds if the server is Running

/join -   Joins the chatroom. Without joining messages will not be sent to
          members of the room and the user will not receive messages.

/leave -  Leaves the chatroom. Messages will no longer be broadcasted and
          user will no longer receive messages

/who -    Will print all current usernames in the chatroom

If the messages is not one of these commands and the user is in the chatroom,
then the message will be broadcasted to all members of the chatroom.

NOTES:
  - Two users with same username cannot join the chatroom at the same time
